# Python Physics Toolbox

## Overview
This repository contains a small collection of reusable scientific Python tools developed as part of the Scientific Python Starter Quest assignment.

The goal of this project is to practice core programming concepts in the context of physics problems.

## Implemented Tasks
1. Plasma Temperature Classifier  
2. Material Properties Lookup  
3. Particle Energy Calculator (OOP)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Functions and conditionals
- Loops and input handling
- Dictionaries and nested data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Basic scientific calculations and unit conversion

## How to Run
1. Install Anaconda (if not already installed).
2. Open the notebook in Spyder or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom.
